# Story: As a developer, I can create a Fish that inherits from Animal.

# Story: As a developer, I can initialize all of my fish to be cold_blooded (yes, there is one fish who is technically fully warm-blooded but we aren't going to talk about that).

# Story: As a developer, I can create a Salmon that inherits from Fish.

# Story: As a developer, I can initialize my Salmon to be a specific species (Atlantic, Sockeye, etc).

# Story: As a developer, I can see that my Salmon is cold-blooded.
